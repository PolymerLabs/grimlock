# Grimlock

> Leader of the Dinobots. Of all the Dinobots, he is the most fearsome and powerful one. Although dedicated to the Autobot cause, resents authority. Cold, merciless, but a valiant warrior. Has contempt for the weak, including all humans. Great strength, uses jaws to break almost anything in two. Carries energon sword and galaxial rocket launcher in Dinobot mode. Other than arrogance and lack of speed, has no real weakness.
